"""Deterministic reproducibility driver for ORASR.

Runs only what the committed source code supports, with a fixed seed, and
writes machine-readable artifacts to ``results/``.

What this driver DOES reproduce (deterministic, portable):
  1. Structural properties of the routing engine verified at runtime:
       - pathway-selection thresholds (0.3 / 0.7);
       - monotonic gate inclusion (FAST=1 gate, NORMAL=3, SAFE=4);
       - non-bypass behaviour (a failed gate marks the routing unsafe and the
         action is not executed).
  2. A synthetic routing cohort (3,500 Fast / 4,500 Normal / 2,000 Safe) routed
     through the real ``ORASRRouter``, producing the pathway distribution and an
     honestly measured gate pass rate.

What this driver does NOT fabricate:
  - Pathway LATENCIES are measured on the current host and written with an
    explicit ``environment`` block. They are wall-clock timings of THIS machine
    and are not portable; the manuscript's literal values (2.3 / 45.2 / 287.5 ms)
    are NOT copied here.
  - The MIMIC-IV retrospective analysis and the flat-monitor baseline are NOT
    reproduced: no clinical dataset and no baseline implementation are committed.
    These gaps are recorded in ``results/gaps.json``.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_all.py

# The clean cohort above passes every gate (100%), so it carries no risk signal

# separate, explicitly-labelled robustness cohort in which a deterministic
# fraction of scenarios carry malformed input (a structurally invalid payload
# that the committed PRECONDITION/POSTCONDITION gates legitimately reject). The
# violation rate is therefore measured by the REAL engine, not assigned by us.
#
#   - "violation" == the engine returns safe == False for an auto-executed action
#     (a true gate-level rejection from the committed validators).
#   - The reject option is an abstention threshold tau on the risk score: any
#     scenario with risk >= tau is DEFERRED (not auto-executed) and removed from
#     coverage; scenarios with risk < tau are auto-executed and contribute to the
#     measured risk. Sweeping tau from 1.0 down to 0.0 traces coverage vs risk.
#   - The marked operating point is the ORASR SAFE threshold (0.7): everything the
#     router already sends to the SAFE pathway is the natural deferral set.
